# Example

I use this project when doing demos of `vue-declassify`. It contains an example project that obtains stronger type safety by transforming its class-based components to object-based ones.

The project is not meant to be built - just looked at from Visual Studio Code. As a result, I've removed any unnecessary build configuration files from the default Vue project skeleton.
